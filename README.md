# Plant Hotel – Java Assignment 1

This was the first assignment for the *Object-Oriented Programming in Java* course in October 2024, where the task was to build a simple plant care assistant system for a fictional plant hotel called **Greenest**. The focus of the project was to practise using core concepts in object-oriented programming such as inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism and encapsulation.

## Project Overview

At Greenest, customers can leave their plants while on vacation. Each type of plant requires specific care and hydration routines. The goal of this program is to calculate and display the correct type and amount of liquid each plant needs per day.

## How the Program Works

1. A dialog box asks: **"Which plant should be watered?"**
2. The user types in the plant’s name.
3. A second dialog shows the correct amount and type of liquid needed.
4. If the name is invalid, an error message is shown.

## Features

- Uses **inheritance** to represent plant types.
- Includes an **interface** to generalize behavior.
- Applies **polymorphism** for handling plants in a unified way.
- Implements **encapsulation** for plant data (required for VG).
- Uses **enums** for liquid types (required for VG).
- Graceful handling of invalid input.
- No hardcoded strings or numbers – constants are stored in variables.

## Grade Criteria

| Grade | Requirements |
|-------|--------------|
| **G** | Functional program using inheritance, interface, and polymorphism. Handles input and output as described. |
| **VG** | Meets all G requirements, **plus** uses `enum` and demonstrates **encapsulation**.|
